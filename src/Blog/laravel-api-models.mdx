### Laravel API Models / Relationship - Tips & Tricks ###

Declare your model (DB entity) can do it running Artisan command : ``php artisan make:model YourModelName ``, but if you want to create an Controller with Model already linked just run: ``php artisan make:controller YourControllerName -m YourModelName``

Note: If you follow best pratices from Laravel there's no reason to define yout entity table name, so for example if you create Model User, Laravel internally knows there's a users table.
Always follow best pratices and you're ok when create some relationships

Imagine you want to Create Questions & Answers Database:

You will need to create a ``Question`` model and ``Ànswer`` model and must have an relationship between both tables:
Something like **Question-> hasMany-> Answer** (Inside Question model there's a answers function to have this relation)

Imagine Question Model:

```code
 class Model {

    public function answers()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Answer::class);
    }
}
```

For answer side must have:

```code 
class Answer {
    
    public function question()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Question::class);
    }
}
```

When you need to retrieve from your DB your questions with answers, you can use with eager loading (remove **N+1** problem with joins 🥵), and just call:

``` Question::with('answers')->all(); ```
