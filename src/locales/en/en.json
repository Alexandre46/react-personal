A subscription system was also created for it, which would give more prominence to the ads sent by paying users of the platform. With this experience I gained autonomy to be able to estimate / carry out work outside the school / university environment and to be able to have a more real approach to the difficulties of the area, dealing with the problems that a system deals with when interacting with the end user."
