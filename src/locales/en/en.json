Sometimes I get home and spend time trying to create new personal projects to try out new technologies, tools or languages. I started this interest in computers from 7-8 years old when my parents bought our first personal computer. In secondary school, I decided to take the technical computer course instead of a general area, and when I went to university I chose Computer Engineering. I finished my degree in Computer Science in 2014 and since 2016 I am working on software development, currently I am in the second company since the university. I've worked in several areas such as multimedia content platforms (films, series), beverage production (MES), banking and content platforms, this gave me some experience in backend and also frontend",

A subscription system was also created for it, which would give more prominence to the ads sent by paying users of the platform. With this experience I gained autonomy to be able to estimate / carry out work outside the school / university environment and to be able to have a more real approach to the difficulties of the area, dealing with the problems that a system deals with when interacting with the end user."
